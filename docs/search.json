Then we took the nunmber of total plays divided by the amount of games that the teams played in.\n\n\nCode\nbigten24 &lt;- logs24 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\")\n\nbigten25 &lt;- logs25 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\navg_plays_24 &lt;- bigten24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_plays = mean(TotalPlays, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(season = \"2024\")\n\navg_plays_25 &lt;- bigten25 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_plays = mean(TotalPlays, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(season = \"2025\")\n\n\nSometimes, team’s offenses run a lot of plays because they want to speed up the pace of the game. But other times, it’s because their defense is unable to get any stops. Ocassionaly, it’s both. That’s what happened with 2024 Maryland, who had one of the worst passing defenses in the Big Ten, allowing opponents to throw for over 300 yards per game in a majority of its Big Ten contests. The Terps’ offense was constantly on the field and trying to play catch up, which led to them running the most amunt of plays.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_24, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#1f77b4\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n labs(title = \"Maryland football finished 4-8.\", subtitle = \"It still ran the most offensive plays in the Big Ten\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Average Offensive Plays\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this season, we’ve seen some drastic shifts in the conference. Ohio State, who has some of the most offensive firepower in the nation, runs the least amount of plays in the Big Ten. That’s most likely due to the Buckeyes’ blowing out several teams, but they also have had one of the nation’s best defenses, and this is a somewhat troubling sign for Ohio State’s future. One other takeaway: teams with strong and older quarterbacks tend to run more plays. Seven of the top eight teams have either old quarterbacks or a strong true freshman signal-caller in the case of Maryland and Malik Washington.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_25, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#ff7f0e\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ohio State's offense is dominant despite not running plays\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Average Offensive Plays\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"

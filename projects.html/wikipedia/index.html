    <p>Brenda Sue Frese (born April 30, 1970)[1] is an American women's basketball head coach and former player. Since
        2002, she has served as the head coach of the University of Maryland women's basketball team. In her fourth year
        as head coach, she won the 2006 Women's National Championship.</p>

        <h2 class="bigstyle"> Before Maryland</h2>
    <p>In her very first game as a head coach, Frese led Ball State to an upset win over Minnesota. Less than two years
        later, Minnesota hired Frese as their new head coach. During her 2001–02 season at Minnesota, she led a one-year
        turnaround of 8–20 to 22–8, one of the biggest in NCAA history. Minnesota made it to the 2nd round of the NCAA
        Championship that year, and Frese was named the AP National Coach of the Year for 2002.</p>

        <h2 class="bigstyle">Coaching at Maryland</h2>
    <p>When Frese arrived at Maryland prior to the 2002–03 season, she brought with her the buzz of a rising star in the
        women's hoops coaching world, as well as a remarkable recruiting acumen. Her first highly coveted recruits, Shay
        Doron and Kalika France, marked the beginning of an ever-expanding stream of blue-chip talent choosing to take
        their talents to College Park. Since her first season at the helm when the team won just 10 games, Frese has
        guided Maryland to a National Championship in 2006, 20 winning seasons, 19-straight 20-win seasons, seven 30-win
        campaigns and 19 bids to the NCAA Tournament. In 2022, she signed an extension which will keep her on the
        Maryland sidelines through the 2028-29 season.</p>
